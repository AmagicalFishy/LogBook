one major thing that you should change: always, when loading a file via require of include, you should use the absolute path. You can get the "current file absolute location" using __DIR__ constant
  
it ends up looking something like: include __DIR__ . '/../some/folder/file.php';

tereško -- when you finish the migration, I will explain, how you can turn it into http://your.site/log/3 (in reference to log GET variables)

------------
STEPS:
- Install LAMP:
    Install: apache2, mysql-server, php, libapache-mod-php, sqlite, php-sqlite3, php7.0-mysql
    Run: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
    Go to localhost

- Place 'logbook' in /var/www/html
- Change 'php.ini' to show errors, then 'systemctl restart apache2'
- Uncomment 'php.ini' lines 890, 894, 898, 907, 908 to enable plugins
